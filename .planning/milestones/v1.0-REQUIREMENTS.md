# Requirements: WhisperX Frontend UI

### Progress

- [x] **PROG-01**: User sees real-time progress via WebSocket (percentage, current stage)
- [x] **PROG-02**: User sees which stage is active (Uploading, Queued, Transcribing, Aligning, Diarizing, Complete)
- [x] **PROG-03**: User sees clear error messages when processing fails

### Transcript Viewer

### Batch Processing

- **BTCH-01**: User can pause/resume batch queue
- **BTCH-02**: User can reorder items in queue
- **BTCH-03**: User can cancel individual items in queue

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time live transcription | Different architecture, WhisperX optimized for batch processing |
| User authentication | Internal/trusted use, no multi-tenancy needed |
| Mobile app | Web-first, desktop/tablet focus |
| Audio/video editing | Transcription only, not an editor |
| Inline transcript editing | Complex state management (undo/redo, timestamp sync), export to editor instead |
| Video player with transcript sync | HTML5 video complexity, format issues |
| Custom vocabulary/dictionary | Requires API support investigation |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| UPLD-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| UPLD-02 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| UPLD-03 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| UPLD-04 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| UPLD-05 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| PROG-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
