## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Individual File Upload and Transcription
expected: Click Start on a single file. File uploads, transcription begins, progress updates show in real-time, completes successfully.
result: issue
reported: "POST http://localhost:5173/service/transcribe 404 - API calls going to Vite dev server instead of being proxied to FastAPI backend"
severity: blocker

### 2. Start All Button
expected: Add multiple files, click "Start All". Files process one at a time with progress visible. Each file completes before the next begins.
result: issue
reported: "Same 404 error - POST http://localhost:5173/service/transcribe not proxied to backend"
severity: blocker

### 3. Auto-Continuation
expected: With multiple files queued, start processing. After first file completes, next ready file automatically starts without clicking Start again.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by API proxy issue (tests 1-2)

### 4. Progress Stage Display
expected: During transcription, current stage shows (Transcribing, Aligning, Diarizing). Progress percentage updates smoothly.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by API proxy issue (tests 1-2)

### 5. Error Handling
expected: If upload or transcription fails, file shows error state with message. Other files in queue remain unaffected.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by API proxy issue (tests 1-2)
