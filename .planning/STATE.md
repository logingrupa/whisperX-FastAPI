## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Bun only for package management
- shadcn/ui + Radix components only (no custom components)
- SRP and DRY principles enforced
- Full descriptive names (no abbreviations)
- Individual file downloads (not ZIP)

**Phase 1 decisions:**
- Reorganized app/schemas.py into app/schemas/ package to avoid import collision
- Used Literal types for WebSocket message type fields
- 30-second heartbeat interval per research recommendation
- Stage-based progress percentages (not time-based) per research recommendation
- Lazy singleton for ProgressEmitter to avoid circular imports

**Phase 2 decisions:**
- Use streaming-form-data library for memory-efficient multipart parsing (Cython-optimized)
- 5GB max file size with early rejection during upload (not after)
- Store uploads in system temp directory (gettempdir() / whisperx_uploads)
- Separate upload_config.py module to avoid circular imports with main Config
- Magic validation happens after upload completes (need full header for reliable detection)
- 8KB header read for reliable magic byte detection
- Canonical extension mapping normalizes variants (.oga -> .ogg, .m4v -> .mp4)

**Phase 3 decisions:**
- Bun for package management (bunx create-vite, bun install)
- Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin (not PostCSS)
- CSS-first syntax: @import "tailwindcss" instead of @tailwind directives
- Skeleton as sibling of #root for CSS :not(:empty) selector
- @/* path alias for all src/ imports (shadcn/ui convention)
